Show support to Charlie Hebdo with a "Je Suis Charlie" ribbon on a corner of your website. Configure the display via the Settings panel.


== Description ==
To show support to <strong>Charlie Hebdo</strong> on your web site, after the terrorists attacks in Paris (January 2015),
this plugin will put a <em>"Je Suis Charlie"</em> ribbon on the (left or right) corner of your website.

The ribbon is half transparent to be able to view the part of the web site underneath the ribbon.
When moving over the ribbon, the ribbon changes to solid display, without any transparency.

When clicking on the ribbon, a new page will be displayed according to your choice from the <em>Settings</em>.
You can choose one out this four choices: the Charlie Hebdo web site, the Charlie Hebdo donation web site, twitter hash tag <em>#JeSuisCharlie</em>, 
or the page you will type in.
If you do not want any link to a web site, just type in <strong>#</strong> as the URL to type.

In the <em>Settings</em>, you will also choose to display the ribbon on the left or on the right.

This has been derived from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/je-suis-charlie/">Julio Potier plugin</a> to add extra functions:
* Ribbon transparency
* Rollover images
* Settings choices (position and URL value)
